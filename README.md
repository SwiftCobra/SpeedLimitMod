### Built using Cities: Skylines 2 - C# Mod template by Captain-Of-Coit [Mod Template](https://github.com/Captain-Of-Coit/cities-skylines-2-mod-template)

### Requirements

- [Cities: Skylines 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/) (duh)
- [BepInEx 5.4.22](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) or later
- [HookUI 0.3](https://github.com/Captain-Of-Coit/hookui)

# Regarding BepInEx version 5 (Stable) VS 6 (Alpha/Unstable/Nightly)

Currently, this mod template defaults to building against BepInEx version 6 (unstable pre-release). If you'd like to instead use Stable BepInEx version 5, you can run the build like this:

```
$ make build BEPINEX_VERSION=5
```
This mod is released on Github and Thunderstore with Bepinex 5.
If you can build from the github sources, using the makefile is easiest. You will need to change paths in the .csproj, and makefile to your local environment before building.
